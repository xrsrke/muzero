## Install

``` sh
pip install -r requirements
pip install -e .
```

### MuZero

- Representation function - $h_{\theta}(o_1, o_2,...o_t)$: It takes the
  history of observations and produces a hidden state $s_o$ of the
  observations

- Prediction function - $f_{\theta}(s^k)$: It takes the hidden state of
  the observation and predicts the policy $\pi^k$ and the value $v^k$

- Dynamic function - $g_{\theta}(s^{k-1}, a^k) = r^k, s^k$: It takes the
  current state and an action, it predicts the next state and reward

### Components

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS: to guide the exploration of the game
state space and select the most promising actions

### TODO

- A replay buffer share between agents
- Monte Carlo Tree Search

### Resources
